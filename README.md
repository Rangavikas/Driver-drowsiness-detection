# Driver-drowsiness-detection
**INTRODUCTION:**

One of the factors contributing to an increase in accident rates is driver drowsiness. It has been suggested that various facial recognition techniques be used to detect and warn motorists in order to prevent accidents. In order to promote transportation safety and decrease the frequency of accidents caused by tired drivers, this approach is proposed. Based on visual data it has gathered, this technology detects driver drowsiness automatically.

Using OpenCV, dlib, and Python, driver drowsiness detection mainly uses the idea of a mathematical value called Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), which is a straightforward and efficient method. The suggested method has a number of benefits over the conventional MATLAB-based face detection methods. It was discovered that increased fatigue causes a rapid decline in driving performance, which causes more than 20% of all vehicle accidents. Less concentration and focus when driving causes the driver to get distracted, which increases the risk of a traffic collision.

**#THE LANGUAGE USED FOR IMPLEMENTATION:**

The requirement for this Python project is a web cam through which we will capture images. You need to have Python 3.6 version recommended installed on your system, then using pip, you can install the necessary packages.
1. OpenCV – pip install opencv-python (Face and eye detection).
2. Imutils – pip install imutils (To get landmarks of the eye).
3.  Scipy – pip install scipy (To calculate distance between eye landmarks).
4. Pygame – pip install pygame (To play alarm sound). 5. Dlib - pip install dlib.

**#conclusion:**

An approach for putting into practice a quick and reliable driver sleepiness detection system has been proposed in this research. This was accomplished using the two libraries OpenCV and dlib as well as the mathematical notion known as EAR. On numerous subjects, the technique was successfully tested, and it was found to be successful
